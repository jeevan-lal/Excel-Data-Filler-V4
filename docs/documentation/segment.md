# Segment

Segment is a part of multiple field actions. It does not run until you execute it. Its structure is exactly like the form, but like the form, we do not need the URL and each segment has a unique name and the segment is executed by this name only.

## Execute Segment

You can get the segment executed through [Field Response Action](field.html#field-response-action).
