# Javascript Code

You can use Javascript code in any field or you can give any field only in **Javascript type**. We have used [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) to edit Javascript code.

```js
// Where your code is ending, add this line only then the form will run further.
localStorage.setItem("EXCEL-DATA-FILLER-V4-EXECUTE-JS-CODE-RESPONSE", "1");
```

## Editor Shortcut keys
