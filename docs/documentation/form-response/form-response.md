# Form Response

After filling the entry, you can set what output comes from the server side after submitting the entry. There are two types of response to entry, either the entry will be successfully saved or there is an error in the entry.

If you are doing multiple entries, when using this you can get the next entry filled in the form and the first entry will be **marked as saved** in the extension.
