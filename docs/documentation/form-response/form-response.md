# Form Response

After filling the entry, you can set what output comes from the server side after submitting the entry. There are two types of response to entry, either the entry will be successfully saved or there is an error in the entry.

- [Success Response](/documentation/form-response/form-success-response)
- [Error Response](/documentation/form-response/form-error-response)
